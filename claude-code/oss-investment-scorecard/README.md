# OSS Investment Scorecard
### 开源项目投资评估框架 · AI周期专版

> **A structured, weighted scoring framework for USD-denominated VC funds evaluating open source projects during the AI technology acceleration cycle.**

Built from practice, not theory — calibrated against real deals including vLLM/Inferact ($150M @ $800M) and Hugging Face ($235M @ $4.5B).

---

## 📖 Framework Overview

| Dimension | Weight | What It Measures |
|-----------|--------|-----------------|
| **A. Open-Source Ecosystem Health** | 25% | Keyboard metrics: active contributors, PR velocity, production dependents, governance tier |
| **B. Team & Globalisation** | 20% | Engineering depth × GTM capability; US market access |
| **C. Technical Moat & Positioning** | 20% | L1-L4 technology ladder; narrative consistency; de facto standard potential |
| **D. Commercialisation & PMF** | 20% | Revenue quality hierarchy; PS vs ARR distinction; customer concentration |
| **E. Capital Exit Path** | 15% | M&A urgency; IPO readiness; comparable exits |

**Score Thresholds:**
- 🟢 **8.5–10.0** → Strongly Recommend
- 🟡 **7.0–8.4** → Recommend with Conditions
- 🟠 **5.5–6.9** → Watch / Track (re-evaluate in 6-9 months)
- 🔴 **< 5.5** → Pass

**One-Vote Vetoes:** 6 conditions that trigger automatic Pass regardless of total score. See [SKILL.md](SKILL.md) for full details.

## 📬 Submit Your Evaluation — Connect with Investors & Founders

**Why submit?**

This repository is maintained by [Lucy Chen](https://linkedin.com/in/lucycxy), EIR (Entrepreneur in Residence) at Zoo Capital, a Singapore-based VC fund with USD $2B+ AUM, focused on broad open-source project investing.

When you submit an evaluation, two things happen:

1. **Your evaluation becomes part of the public record** — other investors and founders can see which projects have been assessed
2. **You get optionally connected** — if you're an investor looking for deal flow, or a founder wanting investor feedback, Lucy can introduce relevant parties

**Who should submit:**
- 🔍 **Investors** who evaluated a project and want deal-sharing partners or co-investors
- 🏗️ **Founders** who want their project professionally scored and introduced to investors
- 📊 **Analysts** building open-source investment theses

### How to Submit

**[→ Submit via GitHub Issue](../../issues/new?template=submit-evaluation.md)**
